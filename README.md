# Machine-Learning-Project COMP 6321

IDE used: jupyter notebook.

/classification-models/
	 10 jupyter notebooks per classification dataset each named as model.ipynb

/regression-models/
	10 jupyter notebooks per regression dataset each named as model.ipynb

/Classifier interpretability/
	model.ipynb - CNN and Decision Tree Implemented on CIFAR10 dataset
	dataset/ - please put the CIFAR10 dataset inside this folder
	

1. To run the entire project run following python script:
	type this command in terminal: python main.py
	
	-It will start executing each jupyter notebook sequentially, a 
	 message regarding which current dataset model is being executed

2. To see the results, please check each jupyter notebook after it completes its execution.
